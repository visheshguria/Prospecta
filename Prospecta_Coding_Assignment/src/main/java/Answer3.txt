Question:3 Question: what are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?


We will make use of Httpstatus code to check the security and reliability of api.

if Http status code is in range of 200-300 then it is successful.

if it is like range of 400 then it is a bad request.

I will also check for the User Authentication etc.

I will also make sure that all the exceptions are handled properly for the proper flow of the Application.
